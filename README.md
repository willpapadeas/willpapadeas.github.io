# **Financial Accountant**

### About

I am a Certified Practising Accountant with 15 years experience in the private sector having worked across a diverse range of industries including hospitality, retail and wholesale apparel to primary healthcare and with a variety of stakeholders to deliver accurate and timely financial information for decision making.

In my roles using my technical accounting skills to deliver accurate and timely financial information, I have also developed a reputation for identifying and capitalising on opportunities to deliver process improvements and enhanced reporting outcomes whilst enabling significant time resource savings as part of the month end close process. I am a proven confident communicator with all levels of management as well as external advisers and have also enjoyed mentoring junior employees and sharing my knowledge gained over the course of my career to date.

Looking to the future, I am keen to continue to grow and advance my career after having developed a strong interest in working with numbers during my education. Whilst the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown was in progress, I have shown initiative in taking the opportunity to successfully complete a Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics with the primary aim of broadening my skillset.
